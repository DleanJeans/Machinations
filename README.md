# Available Resolutions
Open an issue should you need another aspect ratio/resolution other than 16:9:
- [1920x1080](https://dleanjeans.github.io/Machinations?size=1920x1080)
- [1366x768](https://dleanjeans.github.io/Machinations)


# Why
The new and in-the-cloud web version https://machinations.io requires a stable internet connection which can be unreliable and frustrating at times (for me).

You can download the the repo and run it offline on your computer.
